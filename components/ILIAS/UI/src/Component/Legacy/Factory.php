     *     the context of sequence navigations.
     *     We currently lack quite a lot of UI components for describing the
     *     actual contents of the page, e.g. questions, combinations of text/table/form, etc.
     *     Until these components exist an enable us to better describe the
     *     correlations to navigations, the legacy segment is used to contain
     *     rendered HTML.
     *   composition: >
     *     The legacy segment contains html (or any other content) as string;
     *     it also has a title.
     *
     * context:
     *   - A segment is the content affected by operating the sequence navigation.
