# Docker Images 

There are some dockerfiles provided by SR Solutions:
https://hub.docker.com/r/srsolutions/ilias-dev/

You can also use 
```
docker pull srsolutions/ilias-dev
```
Please note that you will have to checkout the ILIAS code seperately and mount 
the local directory to the container.
There is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXiM9dqcOHI) explaining the process.
